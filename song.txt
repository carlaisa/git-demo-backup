I wanna be a billionare, so focking bad
buy all of the things I never had

I wanna be in the cover of Forbes Magazine
Smilling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh Everytime I close my eyes!
I see my name in shinning lights! Oh yeah!
A different city everynight Oh I... I swear..
the world better prepare..
for when I'm a billionare!

-------------------

I'll be playing basketball with the president, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette (good job)
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it (money)
But keep the fives, twenties, tens, and Bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it

I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up (there you go)
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks (you too)
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was, eatin' good, sleepin' soundly
I know we all have a similar dream (uh-huh)
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing
