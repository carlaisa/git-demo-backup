I wanna be a billionare, so focking bad
buy all of the things I never had

I wanna be in the cover of Forbes Magazine
Smilling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh Everytime I close my eyes!
I see my name in shinning lights! Oh yeah!
A different city everynight Oh I... I swear..
the world better prepare..
for when I'm a billionare!

Quiero quitarle a la vida
5 centavitos de felicidad!


All of me, loves all of you!
